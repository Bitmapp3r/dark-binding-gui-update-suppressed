# Dark Binding

This application was built for [Riot Games' 2018 API Challenge](https://www.riotgames.com/en/DevRel/the-riot-games-api-challenge-2018).

Dark Binding allows you to define groups of keybindings to which you can assign individual champions. When you go into a game, Dark Binding will detect your champion and automatically switch to the keybinding page you defined, if any.
